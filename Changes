Revision history for Perl extension Runops::Recorder.

0.09  Sun Nov 13
    - Fixed a warning in the viewer if we haven't seen a TZ yet
    - Added dump() function to dump the buffer to disk
    - Added missing dependencies to Makefile.PL
    
0.08  Sat Nov 12
    - Added an exception viewer which dumps where die was called
    - Timestamp events are now splitted in two - one with seconds and one with
      miliseconds
    - A keyframe is now followed with an switch_file event if we have a file
    - Added -nostore option which prevents continous store to disk. This should 
      be used in combination with -die to only dump snapshots on exceptions
    - Buffer size is configureable via -bs option
    
0.07  Wed Aug 17
    - Keyframes now also record a timestamp so we can search thru our recording

      counter
