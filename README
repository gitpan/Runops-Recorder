NAME
    Runops::Recorder - Runops replacement which saves what is being
    performed

SYNOPSIS
      # will save to a runops-recorder.data file in the current directory
      perl -MRunops::Recorder <program>

      # and then to view the recording
      rr-viewer runops-recorder.data

DESCRIPTION
    Runops::Recorder is an alternative runops which saves what it does into
    a file that can later be viewed using the rr-viewer tool.

VIEWING THE RECORDING
    Use the 'rr-viewer' tool. It just takes the path with the recording as
    an argument. Press 'q' to quit or any other key to step to the next
    event.

TODO
    Record more things such as changes to variables, opened file descriptors
    etc.
